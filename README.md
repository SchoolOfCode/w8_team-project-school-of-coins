## Overview ##
For our Week 8 Front End Team Project, we have decided to recreate the well known card game, Blackjack.
Following the games we have made prior to this project, we decided to take an ambitious attempt to creating this game. The game felt like a challenge considering we planned to program all of the game logic ourselves, and implement some unique features to make our game attractive and unique.

## Breif ##
For our Week 8 Front End Team Project, we decided to pursue the following project idea.

### Create a games app ###
Your games application can be as creative as you like but must use multiple APIs. Think about games such as countdown, Higher or Lower or Scattergories You may add time restrictions, score tracker, and more, but the data underpinning your application must come from other APIs.
